#  Sales Data Analysis Project: Exploring Data Collection, Cleaning, and Insights

## Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of the **data analysis lifecycle**, utilizing a real-world sales dataset (`Week-2-Sales-Data.csv`). The analysis is structured into two main parts: an initial exploration and summarization using **Microsoft Excel**, followed by a deeper dive into **data cleaning and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) calculations using Python (Pandas)**.

The primary goal is to practice essential skills in data collection, management, cleaning, and the extraction of valuable business insights.

##  Getting Started

### Data Source
* **File:** `Week-2-Sales-Data.csv`
* **Description:** A simulated real-world sales transaction dataset containing details such as order dates, product information, units sold, revenue, and geographical data.

### Prerequisites

To replicate or review this analysis, you will need:

1.  **Microsoft Excel** (or compatible spreadsheet software) for Part A.
2.  **Python** (preferably via **Anaconda** distribution) for Part B.
3.  **Jupyter Notebook** (or JupyterLab) for executing the Python code.
4.  **Pandas** library (`pip install pandas`).

##  Part A: Working with Data in Excel

This section focuses on using **Excel's built-in tools** to quickly explore and summarize the data, providing immediate business insights.

### 1. Import and Explore
* **Data Type:** The `Week-2-Sales-Data.csv` file contains **structured data**.
* **Justification:** The data is organized into a fixed schema (rows and columns), where each column represents a specific attribute (e.g., `Order_ID`, `Product_Name`, `Region`), making it easy to query and analyze using tabular methods.
* **Column Purpose Identification:** (Details on each column's purpose are available in the initial project documentation/deliverable.)

### 2. Summarize Sales Insights
The following insights were generated using **Pivot Tables, SUMIF formulas, and Charts** in Excel:

* **a) Total Revenue by Product:** Calculated the sum of revenue for every unique product.
* **b) Total Revenue by Region:** Aggregated total sales figures across different geographical regions.
* **c) Top 3 Best-Selling Products:** Identified the top three products based on the highest total revenue generated.
* **d) Monthly Revenue Trend:** Visualized the total revenue for each month to observe seasonality or growth patterns.
* **e) Regional Revenue Comparison:** A **Bar/Column Chart** was created to visually compare the total revenue generated by each region.

##  Part B: Data Cleaning and KPI Calculation (Python/Pandas)

This section shifts the focus to robust data handling, ensuring data quality, and calculating critical business metrics using **Python's Pandas library** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 3. Import and Clean the Data
The following steps were executed to prepare the data for analysis:

* **Import:** Loaded the `Week-2-Sales-Data.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
* **Assessment:** Checked for:
    * **Missing Values:** Identified columns with `NaN` or null entries.
    * **Duplicates:** Detected and counted fully duplicated rows.
    * **Incorrect Data Types:** Verified that all columns had the appropriate data type (e.g., numbers were numeric, dates were objects/strings).
* **Cleaning:**
    * **Removed Duplicates:** Dropped any fully duplicated rows to ensure unique transactions.
    * **Handled Missing Values:** (Specific handling strategy - e.g., dropping rows/filling with mean/median - is documented in the accompanying notebook.)
    * **Converted Data Type:** Converted the `Order_Date` column to the proper **`datetime` format** for time-series analysis.

### 4. Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were calculated from the cleaned dataset:

* **a) Total Revenue:** The grand total revenue across all sales orders.
* **b) Average Units Sold per Order:** Calculated by dividing the total units sold by the total number of orders (or unique order IDs).
* **c) Total Revenue per Region:** Aggregated total revenue for each sales region (validation against Excel results).
* **d) Highest Revenue-Generating Sales Representative:** Identified the sales representative who contributed the most to the total revenue.
* **e) Top 3 Products by Total Units Sold:** Determined the top three products based on the total quantity of units sold (distinct from revenue-based ranking).
